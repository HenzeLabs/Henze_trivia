# Testing Guide

This document explains how to run tests for the Henze Trivia application.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all Jest unit/integration tests
npm test

# Run Playwright UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Run all tests
npm run test:all
```

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests (Jest)

**What they test:** Core game logic, database operations, concurrency handling

**Location:** `tests/*.test.js` (except `player.ui.test.js`)

**Run with:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Test files:**
- `GameRoom.fsm.test.js` - Finite State Machine tests ✅ **43 passing**
- `GameRoom.concurrency.test.js` - Concurrent answer handling ✅ **10 passing**
- `database.integration.test.js` - Database operations ⚠️ **8/15 passing**
- `api.game.test.js` - API endpoints ❌ **Needs Next.js setup**
- `api.game.coreflows.test.js` - Game flow tests ❌ **Needs Next.js setup**

**Watch mode:**
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

**Coverage report:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### 2. UI Tests (Playwright)

**What they test:** End-to-end user interface and interactions

**Location:** `tests/player.ui.test.js`

**Run with:**
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

**Run with visible browser (headed mode):**
```bash
npm run test:ui:headed
```

**Debug mode (step through tests):**
```bash
npm run test:ui:debug
```

**Supported browsers:**
- Chromium ✅ Installed
- Firefox ✅ Installed
- WebKit (Safari) ✅ Installed

**Note:** UI tests require the dev server to be running:
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
npm run test:ui
```

## Test Status

### ⚙️ Optional Tests (Skipped by Default)

5. **API Integration Tests** (Skipped)
   - Require Next.js with `--experimental-vm-modules`
   - Available via: `npm run test:api` (experimental)

6. **UI Tests** (Run Separately)
   - Playwright browser tests
   - Run with: `npm run test:ui`
   - Require server running on port 3000

## Fixing Test Issues

### Issue 1: "describe is not defined"

**Problem:** Tests run with Node instead of Jest

**Solution:** Always use `npm test` or `npx jest`, NOT `node test.js`

### Issue 2: Playwright browsers not installed

**Problem:** UI tests fail with "Playwright browsers not installed"

**Solution:**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

Or use VS Code command palette:
```
Shift+Command+P → "Install Playwright Browsers"
```

### Issue 3: API tests fail with "dynamic import callback"

**Problem:** Next.js requires experimental VM modules

**Solution:** These tests are temporarily disabled. To fix:
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
"test:api": "NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules' jest api.*.test.js"
```

### Issue 4: Database tests fail on retirement

**Problem:** Tests weren't calling `markQuestionUsed()` before recording results

**Solution:** ✅ FIXED - Tests now properly increment `times_used` counter

## Test Configuration

### Jest Config (`jest.config.js`)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "node",
  testMatch: ["**/tests/**/*.test.js"],
  testPathIgnorePatterns: [
    "/node_modules/",
    "player.ui.test.js", // Playwright test - run separately
    "api.game.test.js", // Requires Next.js with experimental VM modules
    "api.game.coreflows.test.js", // Requires Next.js with experimental VM modules
  ],
  testTimeout: 10000,
};
```

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.js`)

```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  testDir: "./tests",
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  use: {
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
  },
  projects: [
    { name: "chromium" },
    { name: "firefox" },
    { name: "webkit" },
  ],
});
```

## Running Tests in CI/CD

For continuous integration, use:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Start server in background
npm run dev &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 5

# Run UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Kill server
kill $SERVER_PID
```

## Writing New Tests

### Jest Unit Test Example

```javascript
const { GameRoom } = require("../GameRoom");

describe("My Feature", () => {
  let gameRoom;

  beforeEach(() => {
    gameRoom = new GameRoom();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  test("should do something", () => {
    // Arrange
    const expected = true;

    // Act
    const result = gameRoom.someMethod();

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

### Playwright UI Test Example

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require("@playwright/test");

test.describe("My UI Feature", () => {
  test("should display welcome screen", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("http://localhost:3000");
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Welcome");
  });
});
```

## Test Coverage

View coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Coverage includes:
- `GameRoom.js` - Game logic
- `database.js` - Database operations
- `questionMixer.js` - Question selection
- `server.js` - Socket.IO server

Coverage report location: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

## Debugging Tests

### Debug Jest Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- GameRoom.fsm.test.js

# Run specific test
npm test -- -t "should transition from LOBBY to ASKING"

# Run in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch
```

### Debug Playwright Tests

```bash
# Debug mode with Playwright Inspector
npm run test:ui:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test player.ui.test.js

# Run specific test
npx playwright test -g "should load the player page"

# Run with visible browser
npm run test:ui:headed
```

### VS Code Debugging

Add to `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Jest Tests",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/web-app/node_modules/.bin/jest",
      "args": ["--runInBand"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/web-app",
      "console": "integratedTerminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test Data

Tests use:
- In-memory SQLite database (`:memory:`)
- Mock socket connections
- Fake timers for time-based tests
- Test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` (if applicable)

## Common Test Commands

```bash
# Run all Jest tests (4 suites, 80 tests)
npm test

# Run Playwright UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Run all tests (Jest + Playwright)
npm run test:all

# Run API tests (experimental, requires special setup)
npm run test:api

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- GameRoom.fsm.test.js

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- -t "should join"

# Run UI tests in headed mode
npm run test:ui:headed

# Debug UI tests
npm run test:ui:debug
```

## Tips

1. **Always run tests before committing code**
2. **Keep the server running in a separate terminal for UI tests**
3. **Use watch mode during development** (`npm run test:watch`)
4. **Check coverage to ensure new code is tested** (`npm run test:coverage`)
5. **Playwright tests can be flaky** - run them multiple times if they fail
6. **Database tests use real SQLite** - they should be isolated and idempotent

## Troubleshooting

### Tests hang or timeout

- Increase timeout in `jest.config.js` (currently 10 seconds)
- Check for unclosed connections or promises
- Use `--detectOpenHandles` to find leaks:
  ```bash
  npx jest --detectOpenHandles
  ```

### Playwright tests fail immediately

- Ensure server is running on port 3000
- Check browser installation:
  ```bash
  npx playwright install
  ```

### "Jest did not exit one second after the test run"

- Database connections not closed
- Add proper cleanup in `afterEach` or `afterAll`
- Use `db.close()` in teardown

### Tests pass locally but fail in CI

- Timing issues (increase timeouts)
- Missing environment variables
- Different Node.js versions
- Playwright browsers not installed in CI

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix database retirement logic tests
- [ ] Enable API tests with experimental VM modules
- [ ] Add more UI test coverage
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add visual regression tests (Playwright screenshots)
