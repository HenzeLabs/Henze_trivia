## Tips

- **Generate more questions**: Edit `start-game.sh` and change `--num 30` to a higher number
- **Shorter games**: Edit [web-app/gameLogic.js](web-app/gameLogic.js:16) and change `maxRounds: 20` to a lower number
- **Regenerate questions**: Just run `./start-game.sh` again - it will extract fresh messages and generate new questions

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No questions loaded"**
- Run `python generate_questions.py --all` before starting the server

**"Permission denied" for chat.db**
- Make sure Full Disk Access is enabled for your terminal

**"Cannot connect" on phones**
- Make sure all devices are on the same WiFi network
- Use the IP address shown in terminal (not "localhost")

**Questions seem stale**
- Delete `output/chat_export.csv` and run `./start-game.sh` again
