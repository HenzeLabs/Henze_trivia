# Tier 2 Implementation Complete ✅

**Winston Logger Integration + Error Recovery**

All Tier 2 "nice-to-have" polish and safety features have been implemented successfully.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Winston Structured Logger

Created a production-ready logging system with Winston that provides:

- **Structured JSON Logging** - All logs include metadata (player names, IDs, round numbers, etc.)
- **Timestamped Output** - Every log entry has precise timestamps
- **File Rotation** - Automatic log file rotation (5MB max, keeps 5 files)
- **Multiple Transports** - Logs to both files and console
- **Convenience Methods** - Easy-to-use logger.game(), logger.player(), logger.security()

**Files:**
- [web-app/logger.js](web-app/logger.js) - Winston configuration with file/console transports

**Log Files Created:**
- `logs/error.log` - Only error-level messages (5MB max, 5 file rotation)
- `logs/combined.log` - All log levels (5MB max, 5 file rotation)

**Example Log Output:**
```
23:07:13 [info]: 📚 Loading questions from database...
23:07:13 [info]: Loaded 12 questions {"count":12,"composition":{"trivia":5,"who-said-it":3,"chaos":2,"roast":2}}
23:07:13 [info]: 🎮 Game started {"gameId":123,"playerCount":4,"maxRounds":20}
23:07:14 [info]: Player answered {"playerName":"Alice","playerId":"abc123","answerIndex":2,"answerTimeMs":1523,"round":3}
```

### 2. ✅ Integrated Logger Throughout Codebase

Replaced all `console.log()` calls with structured logger calls in:

**server.js:**
- Connection events: `logger.player("Player connected", { socketId })`
- Error handling: `logger.error("Join error", { error, socketId })`
- Server startup: `logger.info("Server started", { hostname, port, env })`
- Graceful shutdown: `logger.info("SIGTERM received, closing server...")`

**GameRoom.js:**
- State transitions: `logger.game("State transition: LOBBY → ASKING", { round, alivePlayers })`
- Player actions: `logger.player("Player joined: Alice", { playerId, totalPlayers })`
- Game flow: `logger.game("Game started", { gameId, playerCount, maxRounds })`
- Warnings: `logger.warn("Player eliminated: Bob", { playerId, alivePlayers })`

### 3. ✅ Try/Catch Error Recovery

Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly restart instructions:

**server.js (lines 466-483):**
```javascript
app.prepare()
  .then(() => {
    // ... server setup
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Catch startup errors and provide restart instructions
    logger.error("❌ Server crashed during startup", {
      error: err.message,
      stack: err.stack
    });

    console.error("\n" + "=".repeat(60));
    console.error("🔴 GAME CRASHED");
    console.error("=".repeat(60));
    console.error(`Error: ${err.message}`);
    console.error("\n💡 To restart:");
    console.error("   cd web-app");
    console.error("   npm run dev");
    console.error("=".repeat(60) + "\n");

    process.exit(1);
  });
```

**What This Does:**
- Catches any errors during Next.js app preparation or server startup
- Logs error details to error.log
- Shows clear, user-friendly error message in terminal
- Provides exact restart command: `cd web-app && npm run dev`
- Exits cleanly with proper error code

---

## Testing Results

### ✅ All Unit Tests Passing

```bash
npm test
```

**GameRoom.fsm.test.js:** 25/25 passing ✅
- State transitions work with logger
- Player management logs correctly
- Answer submission with logging
- Database integration with logging

**GameRoom.concurrency.test.js:** 18/18 passing ✅
- Concurrent answer submission with logging
- Race condition prevention with logging
- Full game simulation with logging

**Total:** 43/43 tests passing with logger integrated ✅

### ✅ Logger Output Quality

From test run output, we can see structured logging is working perfectly:

```
23:08:53 [info]: 👤 Player joined: Alice {"playerId":"bba3e40959520a7e","totalPlayers":1}
23:08:53 [info]: 🎮 Game started {"gameId":123,"playerCount":1,"maxRounds":5}
23:08:53 [info]: 🎮 Round 1 started {"round":1,"questionId":1,"type":"trivia","questionPreview":"Q1?"}
23:08:53 [info]: 🎮 State transition: LOBBY → ASKING {"round":1,"alivePlayers":1}
```

Every log entry includes:
- ✅ Timestamp (HH:mm:ss)
- ✅ Log level (info, warn, error)
- ✅ Emoji indicator (🎮 game, 👤 player, 🔒 security)
- ✅ Descriptive message
- ✅ Structured metadata (JSON)

## Verification Checklist

- [x] **Winston logger created** - [web-app/logger.js](web-app/logger.js)
- [x] **Logger integrated into server.js** - All console.log replaced
- [x] **Logger integrated into GameRoom.js** - All console.log replaced
- [x] **Try/catch wrapper added** - Catches startup errors
- [x] **User-friendly error messages** - Shows restart instructions
- [x] **All tests passing** - 43/43 tests ✅
- [x] **Log files will auto-create** - logs/error.log and logs/combined.log
- [x] **File rotation configured** - 5MB max, 5 files kept

---

## How to Use

### Normal Operation

Just start the server as usual:
```bash
cd web-app
npm run dev
```

**Console Output:**
- Colored, timestamped logs in development
- Clear game events with emoji indicators
- Player actions logged with metadata

**Log Files (created automatically):**
- `logs/combined.log` - All logs (info, warn, error)
- `logs/error.log` - Only errors

### If Server Crashes

If the server crashes during startup, you'll see:

```
============================================================
🔴 GAME CRASHED
============================================================
Error: [specific error message]

💡 To restart:
   cd web-app
   npm run dev
============================================================
```

**Log File Contains:**
- Full error stack trace
- Timestamp of crash
- All events leading up to crash

### Viewing Logs

**Tail live logs:**
```bash
tail -f logs/combined.log
```

**View errors only:**
```bash
tail -f logs/error.log
```

**Search logs:**
```bash
grep "Player joined" logs/combined.log
grep "error" logs/combined.log
```

---

## Log Retention Policy

- **Max file size:** 5 MB per file
- **Max files kept:** 5 files (rotates automatically)
- **Total disk usage:** ~25 MB for combined.log + ~25 MB for error.log = **50 MB max**

When a log file reaches 5MB:
1. `combined.log` → `combined.log.1`
2. `combined.log.1` → `combined.log.2`
3. Oldest file (`combined.log.5`) is deleted
4. New `combined.log` is created

---

## Success Criteria Met ✅

From Tier 2 requirements:

> "Tier 2 – Nice-to-have (polish & safety):
> - Drop in the simple logger.js (Winston or even just timestamped console.log wrappers) ✅
> - Add a basic try/catch around main() with a restart message ✅
> - Optional PM2 config for auto-restart ⏸️ (not needed yet)"

**Result:** 2/2 completed (PM2 config deferred as optional)

---

## What's Left (Tier 3 - Explicitly Ignore)

These were marked as "Ignore for now" by user:
- ❌ Sentry integration (full error tracking service)
- ❌ CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- ❌ Load testing (stress tests with 100+ concurrent players)
- ❌ Coverage metrics reporting (detailed test coverage reports)
