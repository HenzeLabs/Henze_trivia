# Implementation Summary

All six requested components have been implemented for your Jackbox-style trivia game.

---

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. SQLite Schema + Database Setup
**File**: [web-app/database.js](web-app/database.js)

- Complete database layer with `better-sqlite3`
- Tables: `questions`, `games`, `game_results`, `player_answers`
- Methods for CRUD operations, learning loop, stats
- Automatic table creation and indexing
- WAL mode for better concurrency

**Key Features**:
- Track question performance (times_used, correct_rate, laugh_score)
- Record all game results and player answers
- Query top performers and identify questions to retire
- Automatic learning loop execution

---

### 2. CSV Migration Script
**File**: [scripts/migrate_csv_to_sqlite.js](scripts/migrate_csv_to_sqlite.js)

- Imports all existing CSV questions into SQLite
- Handles multiple question types (trivia, who-said-it, chaos, roast)
- Validates data before insertion
- Shows detailed migration report

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/migrate_csv_to_sqlite.js
```

---

### 3. GameRoom FSM Class
**File**: [web-app/GameRoom.js](web-app/GameRoom.js)

- Finite state machine with proper guards
- States: `LOBBY → ASKING → ANSWERS_LOCKED → REVEAL → ROUND_END → GAME_END`
- Enforces valid transitions only
- Built-in timers for each state

**Key Features**:
- **Security**: `getSanitizedQuestion()` hides correct answer from clients
- Atomic state transitions prevent race conditions
- Automatic database tracking of all game events
- Ghost player system (eliminated players)
- Learning loop trigger on game end

**State Transition Guards**:
```javascript
// Example: Can only go from ASKING to ANSWERS_LOCKED
if (!canTransition(ANSWERS_LOCKED)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid transition");
}
```

---

### 4. Question Payload Sanitizer
**Implementation**: Built into `GameRoom.js`

The sanitizer ensures correct answers are NEVER sent to clients during gameplay:

```javascript
// During ASKING state
getSanitizedQuestion() {
  const { answer_index, ...safe } = this.currentQuestion;
  return safe;  // answer_index removed!
}

// During REVEAL state (after answers locked)
getQuestionWithAnswer() {
  return {
    ...this.currentQuestion,
    correctAnswer: this.currentQuestion.answer_index
  };
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Old system sent everything to clients (answer visible in DevTools)
- New system only reveals answer after state transitions to REVEAL
- Clients physically cannot cheat by inspecting network traffic

---

### 5. Type Mixing Algorithm
**File**: [web-app/questionMixer.js](web-app/questionMixer.js)

- Generates balanced question packs with configurable ratios
- Default: 60% trivia, 15% who-said-it, 10% chaos, 15% roast
- Strategic ordering: interleaves types for variety
- Avoids questions used in last N days

**Algorithm**:
1. Calculate count per type based on ratios
2. Fetch 2x questions from DB for each type (buffer)
3. Select best based on criteria:
   - Prioritize high laugh_score for chat questions
   - Balance difficulty if requested
   - Favor less-used questions
4. Shuffle within types
5. Interleave types (trivia → chat → trivia → chat)

**Usage**:
```javascript
const pack = generateQuestionPack(20, {
  "trivia": 0.60,
  "who-said-it": 0.15,
  "chaos": 0.10,
  "roast": 0.15
}, {
  excludeDays: 30,
  prioritizeLaughs: true
});
```

---

### 6. Question Generation with OpenAI
**File**: [scripts/generate_questions.py](scripts/generate_questions.py)

- Uses OpenAI structured outputs with strict JSON schema
- Pydantic models enforce validation
- Automatic retry if schema fails
- Extracts distinctive messages from iMessage

**Question Types Generated**:

1. **Trivia** (15 per run)
   - General knowledge (pop culture, sports, history)
   - Plausible distractors
   - Concise explanations

2. **Who Said It?** (5 per run)
   - Pulls actual quotes from chat
   - Validates speaker names against roster
   - Distractors are people who COULD have said it

3. **Roast** (5 per run)
   - Personality analysis from message patterns
   - Light-hearted, not mean-spirited
   - Based on actual behaviors (emoji usage, response time, etc.)

**Pydantic Schema Example**:
```python
class TriviaQuestion(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["trivia"]
    text: str = Field(min_length=10, max_length=500)
    options: List[str] = Field(min_items=4, max_items=4)
    answer_index: int = Field(ge=0, le=3)
    explanation: str
    category: str
    difficulty: Literal["easy", "medium", "hard"]

    @validator("options")
    def validate_options(cls, v):
        if len(set(v)) != 4:
            raise ValueError("All options must be unique")
        return v
```

**Usage**:
```bash
python scripts/generate_questions.py
```

---

### 7. Learning Loop System
**Implementation**: Built into `database.js`

Automatically tracks and improves question quality:

**Metrics Tracked**:
- `times_used`: How many times question has been asked
- `correct_rate`: % of players who get it right
- `laugh_score`: Average laugh votes per use
- `avg_answer_time_ms`: How long players take to answer

**Auto-Retirement Logic**:
```javascript
// Retire if:
- correct_rate > 95% (too easy)
- correct_rate < 15% (too hard / unclear)
- laugh_score < 0.1 for chat questions (not funny)
- After minimum 5 uses
```

**Runs After Each Game**:
```javascript
// In GameRoom._finalizeGame()
setTimeout(() => {
  const results = this.db.runLearningLoop();
  console.log(`🧠 Learning: ${results.questionsUpdated} updated, ${results.questionsRetired} retired`);
}, 1000);
```

**Query Top Performers**:
```javascript
db.getTopQuestions('roast', 10);  // Top 10 roast questions
db.getTopTopics(10);              // Topics with most laughs
```

## 📊 Architecture Comparison

### Before (CSV + Shared State)
```
CSV → Parse → Global Object → Send Everything → Race Conditions
```
**Problems**: Answer visible, state shared, no learning, race conditions

### After (SQLite + FSM)
```
SQLite → Type Mixer → GameRoom FSM → Sanitized Payloads → Learning Loop
                          ↓
                    State Guards
                    Hidden Answers
                    Atomic Transitions
```
**Benefits**: Secure, robust, self-improving
